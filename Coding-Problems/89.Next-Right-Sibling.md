# 89. Next Right Sibling

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Next-Right-Sibiling

#

### Problem Description

Given a DOM tree and a target element, please return the **next right sibling**.

![A DOM tree](https://i.imgur.com/DUICfa3.png 'A DOM tree')

Like above, the next right sibling of `<button/>` is the blue `<a/>`. Notice that **they don't necessarily have the same parent element**.

If no right sibling, then return `null`.

What is time & space cost of your solution ?

#

### Understanding the problem

I am given a DOM tree and a target element. I am tasked with finding the right sibling of the target element. The target element and its right sibling don't necessarily have the same parent element. If right sibling doesn't exit, return `null`.

#

### Approach

We could solve this problem with iterative Breadth First Search. With Breadth First Search, the element to right of the target element in the queue is either the right sibling or the first element in the next tree level. We can use `null` as indication that we reach the end of a level. At the very beginning of our function, we initialize a queue and enqueue the root node into it. In addition, we also enqueue `null` into the queue, since there is only node in the first tree level. When we traverse the DOM tree, dequeueing node out of the queue, and come across a `null` value, then we know we are at the end of a level, so we enqueue a `null` value into the queue to indicate the end of the next level. When we get to the target element, return the element at the front of the queue.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} root
 * @param {HTMLElement} target
 * @return {HTMLElemnt | null}
 */
function nextRightSibling(root, target) {
  const queue = [root, null];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const node = queue.shift();

    if (node === target) {
      return queue[0];
    }

    if (node === null) {
      queue.push(null);
    } else {
      queue.push(...node.children);
    }
  }

  return null;
}
```
