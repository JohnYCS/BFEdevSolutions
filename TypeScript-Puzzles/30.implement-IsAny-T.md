# 30. implement IsAny\<T\>

#

### Problem Description

Implement `IsAny<T>` to check against `any`.

```ts
type A = IsAny<string>; // false
type B = IsAny<any>; // true
type C = IsAny<unknown>; // false
type D = IsAny<never>; // false
```

#

### Solution

```ts
// type IsAny<T> = 0 extends 1 & T ? true : false;
type IsAny<T> = false extends true & T ? true : false;
```

### Explanation

`true & T` is an intersection type, which combines multiple types into one:

```ts
interface A {
  a: number;
}
interface B {
  b: number;
}

const ab: A & B = { a: 1, b: 1 };
const a: A = ab; // A & B assignable to A
const b: B = ab; // A & B assignable to B
```

If we combine two incompatible types, the result is going to be `never`, since a value cannot be two different types at the same time:

```ts
type A = boolean & string;
// type A = never
```

If we merge a type with `any`, then it is reduced to `any`:

```ts
type A = true & any;
// type A = any
```

`false extends true` is never true, so should be `false extends true & T`. However, if `T` is `any`, `false extends true & any` is then reduced to `false extends any`, which is true.

It seems that we could also use `false extends true | T`, since `true | any` is also reduced to `any`. However, `true | unknown` evaluates to `unknown` and `false` is assignable to `unknown`, thus `IsAny<unknown>` will also return `true`.
