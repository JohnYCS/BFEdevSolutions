## 56. call APIs with pagination

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/call-APIs-with-pagination

### Problem Description

Have you ever met some APIs with pagination, and needed to recursively fetch them based on response of previous request ?

Suppose we have a `/list` API, which returns an array `items`.

```js
// fetchList is provided for you
const fetchList = (since?: number) =>
  Promise<{items: Array<{id: number}>}>
```

1. for initial request, we just fetch `fetchList`. and get the last item id from response.
2. for next page, we need to call `fetchList(lastItemId)`.
3. repeat above process.

The `/list` API only gives us 5 items at a time, with server-side filtering, it might be less than 5. But if none returned, it means nothing to fetch any more and we should stop.

You are asked to create a function that could return arbitrary amount of items.

```js
const fetchListWithAmount = (amount: number = 5) { }
```

**note**

You can achieve this by regular loop, even fancier solutions with [async iterators or async generators](https://javascript.info/async-iterators-generators). You should try them all.

### Solution

```js
// fetchList is provided for you
// const fetchList = (since?: number) =>
//   Promise<{items: Array<{id: number}>}>

// you can change this to generator function if you want
const fetchListWithAmount = async (amount = 5) => {
  const items = [];
  let lastItemId = null;

  while (items.length <= amount) {
    const response = lastItemId
      ? await fetchList(lastItemId)
      : await fetchList();
    if (!response || !response.items.length) {
      break;
    }
    items.push(...response.items);
    lastItemId = items[items.length - 1].id;
  }

  return items.slice(0, amount);
};
```
